# Information about the .tsv files that need to be created before running any experiment

1. samples-manifest.tsv
This file contains the paths where the .fastq files that we want to analyze can be found.

2. samples-metadata.tsv
This file contains the metadata information of the chosen files; any information can be added here. 

*** IMPORTANT! ***

Qiime2 created a plugin that can be used in Google Sheets, called Keemei, for making sure that the previous .tsv files are well created for Qiime2 use. So we recommend to use it. 
Install Keemei:
1) Log-in in your google account and open a Google Sheet
2) Click on Extensions --> Add-ons --> Get-add-ons and search for Keemei and add it. 

Once Keemei is installed you can just create both .tsv files in your Google Sheets and run Keemei to see if there is any error in the files (Note!: COLNAMES must not contain -, so use _ instead). If everything is ok, download the .tsv files and save them in your experiment folder.
